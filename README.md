# UFOs

## Overview

  This project is a continuation of a previous html (**index_1.html**) that displays a java array of ufo sighting information as a sortable table and allows users to sort table display by ufo sighting date.  To further advance the sorting options, the original javascript (**app_1.js**) that sorted the java array (**data.js**) was modified to allow users to sort the **data.js** and update the table based on a change to one or a combination of all of the defined search terms.  The search values included in the modification are:
  
  *  **Date - UFO sighting event date**
  *  **City - City of sighting event**
  *  **State - State of sighting event**
  *  **Country - Country of sighting event**
  *  **Shape - Shape of UFO sighted**
